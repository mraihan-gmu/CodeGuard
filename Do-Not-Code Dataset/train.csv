WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates, interest groups, unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle, an analysis shows. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year Â» . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups ""pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode."" ""What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,"" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

 Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
 each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
 inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

 You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
 from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
 in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
 cell.
 Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
 necessarily distinct).
 You CANNOT go off the grid.
 A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
 after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
 through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
 than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
 such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
 lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
 It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
 Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.
